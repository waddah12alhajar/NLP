Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset - comparative study

This project investigates sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset which consists of 50,000 movie reviews. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the performance of sentiment classification models using two distinct approaches: traditional TF-IDF vectorization with machine learning algorithms, and BERT text classification model.

The study begins with cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis of the IMDB dataset, then the dataset is split into training and testing sets. Traditional machine learning models, including Multinomial NaiveBayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were trained using TF-IDF vectorization, a widely adopted technique for text data. Subsequently, the research explores the utilization of BERT-based model for sequence classification, which is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, in which I used the "bert-base-uncased" pre-trained model.

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall were used to assess the effectiveness of each model. This empirical study contributes to the broader understanding of different sentiment analysis techniques and algorithms.
